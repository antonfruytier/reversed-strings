 ### strategy explanation
 
 we want to re-order the letters in our string, numbers are inherantly ordered.
 So we will take advantage of that by associating our letters with numbers, ordering the numbers, 
 and mapping back to the letter world. 
 In reversing our numbers , we are reversing our string.
